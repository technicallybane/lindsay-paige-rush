  bio: I'm a copywriter with in-house and agency experience, committed to bringing
    ideas to life. But not just any ideas. Informed ideasâ€”based on your audience,
    your brand and the cold hard reality of what the data is telling us. I like to
    throw some creativity and a wee bit of fairy dust into the mix as well to create
    marketing that's memorable. Your brand deserves a spotlight.
